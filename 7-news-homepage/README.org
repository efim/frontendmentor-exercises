*** What I learned

**** grid layout
watched 70% of wes bos course

very interesting and usefl: repeate(auto-fit, size)
having max size to not have more than 3 columsn, but have 3 on lesser - automatic middle 2 column presentation

another cool thing is centering content with side white space, if I want white space to go to 0 before the middle content starts diminishing:
#+begin_src scala
    div(
      className := "font-inter",
      // this doesn't prefer decreasing empty space as much as i want.
      // className := "md:grid md:pt-40 md:grid-cols-[minmax(0,_20%)_1fr_minmax(0,_20%)]",
      // let's try to get left and right empty space with flex-box
      className := "flex flex-col items-center",
      div(
        className := "max-w-[1150px] width-full",
        PageHeader.render(),
        renderContent(appStateSignal),
      )
    )
#+end_src

previous attempt with grid and =minmax(0, 20%)= empty columns decreased all columns in some part

**** positioning "fixed"
Instead of "relative" and "absolute", used to locate element in relation to the "overall screen", regardless of parents.
With that placing, mobile menu and overlay are not constrained by scrolling content.
**** using already downloaded fonts in tailwind
***** import them in =style.css=
#+begin_src css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  src: url('/assets/fonts/static/Inter-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: 400; /* Regular */
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  src: url('/assets/fonts/static/Inter-Bold.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: 700; /* Bold */
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  src: url('/assets/fonts/static/Inter-ExtraBold.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: 800; /* ExtraBold */
  font-style: normal;
}
#+end_src
***** register in tailwind theme:
#+begin_src js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.scala",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        'inter': ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
#+end_src
***** now it should be available to set:
#+begin_src scala
    div(
      className := "font-inter",
      " Home "
    )
#+end_src
**** i can use 'hsl' colors from style-guide.md directly in tailwind config!

*** Continued development
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: continued-development
:END:
For next couple of tasks I'd want something with more logic coding,
and also something with webcomponents integration.

I'd want to remember to use dev tools to troubleshoot sources of padding\margin,
and would be cool to practice a more complicated Grid layout.

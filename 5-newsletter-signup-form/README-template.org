*** The challenge
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-challenge
:END:
Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting
  the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's
  screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

*** Screenshot
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
[[./screenshot.jpg]]

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use
Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a
Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped
one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best
to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like
[[https://getfireshot.com/][FireShot]] to take the screenshot. FireShot
has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your
project, and update the file path in the image above.

*Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your
screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove
this entire section.*

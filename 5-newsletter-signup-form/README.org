*** What I learned

:END:
**** adding .ttf fonts to tailwind config
need to list them in =style.css=
#+begin_example css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Roboto';
  src: url('/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: 400; /* normal */
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Roboto';
  font-weight: 700; /* bold */
  font-style: normal;
  src: url('/fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf') format('truetype');
}
#+end_example
and then add to config:
#+begin_example js
const defaultTheme = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme')

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.scala",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        'custom': ['Roboto', ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
#+end_example
**** preventing form submission with laminar
html5 validation didn't style as i wanted, so removed "type = email"
and had to code logic to disable input that submits the form
*** Continued development
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: continued-development
:END:
What's not finished - form is not submitted on empty input, but the input is not being marked as invalid. Only on loss of focus, or attempt to submit invalid value.
Would like to also cover that.

Also - i'm not entirely sure that my styling of the "top level" component will play well with attempt to embed it into some website.

*** Useful resources
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: useful-resources
:END:
Honestly, I asked ChatGPT about using already downloaded .ttf files, and about making form unsubmittable in Laminar.

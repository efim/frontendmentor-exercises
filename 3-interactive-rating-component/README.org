  size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

*** First time used =justify-between= for flex children
#+begin_example scala
      div(
        className := "flex flex-row justify-between py-6 w-full",
        className := "lg:py-8 lg:pb-10",
        votes.map(vote =>
          renderRatingSelector(vote, setVote, isSelectedVoteSignal(vote))
        )
      ),
#+end_example

this is for "vote" buttons.
Justify between means spread out dynamically, keeping first and last children at the borders of the parent.
Looks like what I wanted

*** I think during this exercise I figured out better "Attribution" placement:
making it =absolute=, so that main body content would be centered and close enough to the reference design in the "frondtendmentor" screenshot widget.

*** I think during this exercise I started sorting the Tailwind classes
VSCode has a plugin, that could probably be configured with alternate regex.

I'm using Emacs and "[[https://github.com/merrickluo/lsp-tailwindcss][emacs tailwind lsp]]" didn't work for me
1) autocomplete of classes seemed very slow (thought still impressive =D )
2) class sorting worked in typescript projects, didn't work in Scala

So, I'm using "rustywind" directly, installed so it's available on PATH,
#+begin_src bash
rustywind . --custom-regex "className := \"([^\"]+)\"" --write
rustywind . --custom-regex "className := \"([^\"]+)\"" --check-formatted
#+end_src

Or, actually, ugly hack to run it after file save:
#+begin_src elisp
(defun my/rustywind-in-project-root ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((command (mapconcat 'identity
                            (list "rustywind ."
                                  "--custom-regex"
                                  (shell-quote-argument "className := \"([^\"]+)\"")
                                  "--write") " ")))
    (projectile-run-shell-command-in-root command)
    (revert-buffer t t)))

;; to start auto format
(add-hook 'after-save-hook #'my/rustywind-in-project-root)
;; to disable auto format
(remove-hook 'after-save-hook #'my/rustywind-in-project-root)
#+end_src
